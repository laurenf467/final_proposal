# Team Registation and Proposal

## The tentative project title 



## The motivation for this project

Stop and Frisk has been a controversial police tactic used for years as a way to briefly stop and search civilians who are of suspect. Police must have "reasonable suspicion" according to the fourth amendment to legally stop a person. Utilizing NYC Stop and Frisk data, we want to give insight into the most influential factors of those who are targeted by the Stop and Frisk tactic.
