## The tentative project title

## The motivation for this project

Stop and Frisk has been a controversial police tactic used for years as
a way to briefly stop and search civilians who are of suspect. Police
must have “reasonable suspicion” according to the fourth amendment to
legally stop a person. Utilizing NYC Stop and Frisk data, we want to
give insight into the most influential factors of those who are targeted
by the Stop and Frisk tactic.

## The intended final products

## The anticipated data sources

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

#### Analysis

  - Where do stops happen in NYC?
      - Visual: Map of stops in NYC using xy coordinates in data
  - Are there trends in stops across time (over a year or by hour of
    day)?
      - Visual: Line plot of stops over time
  - Regression analysis to identify key factors to predict if someone
    who was stopped will then be frisked
      - Visual: ROC curve
  - Compare listed reasons that individuals were stopped
      - Visual: Bar chart

#### Coding challenges

  - With over 12,000 rows and 112 columns, wrangling this dataset may be
    tricky
  - Check data quality and inconsistencies
  - Column names and values are not informative, so they need to be
    changed
  - Missing values will need to be addressed
  - Based on the provided data dictionary, it appears that there are
    issues with the `datestop` column that will need to be fixed before
    analysis

  - Come up with final research questions and ideas for visualizations

###### Week 3 (Nov. 18th - Nov. 22nd):

  - Exploratory analysis, visualizations, summaries, and statistical
    analysis

###### Week 4 (Nov. 25th - Nov. 29th):

  - Build website
